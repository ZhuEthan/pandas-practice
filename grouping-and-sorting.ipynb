However, often we want to group our data, and then do something specific to the group the data is in. \n\nAs you'll learn, we do this with the `groupby()` operation.  We'll also cover some additional topics, such as more complex ways to index your DataFrames, along with how to sort your data.\n\n**To start the exercise for this topic, please click [here](https://www.kaggle.com/kernels/fork/598715).**\n\n# Groupwise analysis\n\nOne function we've been using heavily thus far is the `value_counts()` function.
